1	Bibliographic references must be unambiguous and uniform. We recommend giving the

1	[Smith and Jones 1999].
1	The references must be listed using 12 point font size, with 6 points of space
1	before each reference. The first line of each reference should not be indented, while the
1	subsequent should be indented by 0.5 cm.
